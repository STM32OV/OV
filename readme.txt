STM32 Open Ventilator

Distribute under GPL License.

This initiative is intended to supply a simple 3d printable design for an emergency ventilator much needed during the time of crysis based on a brushless 3 servo design.

You can see our channel here with the first ventilator being built according to these plans that is indended to run 24 hours a day.

One concern for now is that the fingers have a tendency to leave a mark on the ambu. This will be corrected soon.

The controller is built around the STM32F407VGT6 Disco breakout board.

The electronics are now built by hand but we can easily turn it into a PCB shield to be stacked onto the arduino.

Should you be a doctor in need of such systems, get in touch with us at stm32openv@gmail.com, contacting us on github or leaving comments on youtube. Shall the addresses change we will make sure to update you.
